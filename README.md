A simple Loot Check app, where the user can deposit and withdraw money. The app also shows the converted value of the balance in Bitcoin.

This app was developed following [Udemy's React TDD tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/react-tdd/learn/v4/t/lecture/7958262?start=0), with the aim of improving my understanding of TDD and BDD in React, along with starting to familiarise with Redux.
